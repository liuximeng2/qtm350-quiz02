    "text": "Life expectancy is a key demographic indicator that measures the average number of years a person is expected to live, based on current mortality rates. It is closely linked to the overall health, quality of life, and access to healthcare in a population. As life expectancy increases, populations tend to grow older, leading to shifts in age distributions and increased demand for resources related to elderly care.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load data\ndf = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')\n\n# Scatter plot\nplt.scatter(df['life_expectancy'], df['population_millions'], alpha=0.5)\n\n# Fit a linear regression model using numpy\nm, b = np.polyfit(df['life_expectancy'], df['population_millions'], 1)\n\n# Plot the regression line\nplt.plot(df['life_expectancy'], m*df['life_expectancy'] + b, color='red')\n\n# Add labels and title\nplt.title('Life Expectancy vs Population (in millions) with Regression Line')\nplt.xlabel('Life Expectancy (years)')\nplt.ylabel('Population (millions)')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Figure 1 demonstrates a moderate posite correlation between life expectanct and population."
