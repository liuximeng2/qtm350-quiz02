title: "Life-Population"

Life expectancy is a key demographic indicator that measures the average number of years a person is expected to live, based on current mortality rates. It is closely linked to the overall health, quality of life, and access to healthcare in a population. As life expectancy increases, populations tend to grow older, leading to shifts in age distributions and increased demand for resources related to elderly care.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-life-pop 

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')

# Scatter plot
plt.scatter(df['life_expectancy'], df['population_millions'], alpha=0.5)

# Fit a linear regression model using numpy
m, b = np.polyfit(df['life_expectancy'], df['population_millions'], 1)

# Plot the regression line
plt.plot(df['life_expectancy'], m*df['life_expectancy'] + b, color='red')

# Add labels and title
plt.title('Life Expectancy vs Population (in millions) with Regression Line')
plt.xlabel('Life Expectancy (years)')
plt.ylabel('Population (millions)')

plt.show()


```

- The @fig-life-pop demonstrates a moderate posite correlation between life expectanct and population.
